# compiler

This project is my attempt of compiler. At the moment I'm only interested in the lexer and parser,
because getting them working is an important part of another programs.

## Lexer
This is done using a state machine. It is a conscious re-inventing of the wheel (there are programs outside
that make the lexical analysis much better, i.e. flex), in order to learn and think about this kind of programs
